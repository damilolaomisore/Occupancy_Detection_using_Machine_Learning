# Occupancy_Detection_using_Machine_Learning
In building automation and energy management, occupancy detection is an essential responsibility. In this paper, I investigate the application of machine learning methods for commercial building occupancy detection. I assess how well several classification models—such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, and naive bayes—perform. To forecast the occupancy state, we employ a collection of sensor values for temperature, humidity, CO2, and light levels. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score criteria are used to assess the models. The logistic regression model, which I find has the best accuracy of 98.9%, suggests that it is an appropriate technique for occupancy detection. The findings demonstrates that effective occupancy detection has the potential to significantly reduce energy use and enhance building management. Future studies may examine the use of more sophisticated machine learning methods for applications like indoor air quality prediction and workplace design optimisation, in addition to occupancy detection.
